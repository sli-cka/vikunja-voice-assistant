Say **“create a task”** or **“add a task”** → Your task goes straight into Vikunja!

> **⚠️ Important Notice (Breaking Changes):**
> This version now uses Home Assistant's AI Task (`ai_task.generate_data`) pipeline instead of calling OpenAI directly.
> After updating from a version before 2.0.0, you MUST reconfigure the integration:
> - Select a compatible AI Task entity.
> - Confirm your Vikunja API URL/token.
> - Verify user assignment and other options.
> If you were using user assignments before version 1.4.6, you will need to create a new Vikunja token with the `Projectusers` permission for user assignments to work again.

⏱️ *Create your first task in under 2 minutes!*

1. In HACS → Search: **[Vikunja Voice Assistant](https://home.coprin.ovh/hacs/repository/998003183)** → Install

2. Restart Home Assistant

3. Go to *Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration*

   * **AI Task entity**
     Select the Home Assistant `ai_task` entity that is configured to run your preferred LLM via `ai_task.generate_data`.
     The integration sends a structured prompt to this entity; no direct OpenAI configuration is required in this integration anymore.

     This keeps all model and provider configuration in Home Assistant while Vikunja Voice Assistant focuses on prompt building and Vikunja task creation.

6. ✅ Done – Just say **"create a task"** !

## 🤖 AI Task and AI Provider Setup

Starting from version 2.0.0, this integration relies on Home Assistant's AI Task (`ai_task.generate_data`) pipeline instead of calling OpenAI directly.

### Supported AI Providers (Examples)

You can use any AI provider that exposes an AI Task entity compatible with `ai_task.generate_data`.

- Local LLM providers:
  - Ollama
- Cloud LLM providers:
  - OpenAI
  - Google Gemini
  - OpenRouter

For configuration details and the latest list of supported providers, refer to the official Home Assistant documentation:

- AI & LLM setup: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/?cat=ai
- AI Task (`ai_task`) integration: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ai_task/

### Recommended Setup

1. Configure an `ai_task` entity in Home Assistant using your preferred provider.
2. In the Vikunja Voice Assistant integration options, select this AI Task entity.

## 🤖 AI Conversation Agent (Recommended)

Append this to your Home Assistant Voice Assistant’s conversation Agent custom instructions:


```
If the user mentions or implies creating or adding a new task,
always call this tool (do not leave any field empty):

tool_name: VikunjaAddTask
tool_args: {
  task_description: "<exact user sentence>",
}
```
*This will allow your voice assistant to create tasks even if the keywords were missing.*
